CHECKING THE VERSION
To verify which version of DataAdapter you're running: 
  - Logon to the DataAdapter web interface: https://localhost:8090/VLDS/ 
  - Select the Home tab on the left.  Find the DataAdapter Version ID: line, If it is a developer's custom build, the build number will be followed by this warning:  (This is an un-official developer's version) 

CHANGING THE ROOT PASSWORD:  To change the root password you must copy the hashed/encrypted password into the shiro.ini file.
        - create the encrypted password by opening a Windows command prompt and changing to the root installed directory.
        - run this command: java -jar shiro-tools-hasher-1.2.1-cli.jar -p 
           - I had to click on properties in Windows and spefically allow it to be run.
        - NOTE: Version number for above may change, check the current name.
        - enter the password you'd like to encrypt. (will ask you twice.)
        - copy the resultant string into the shiro.ini file after "Root =" in the [user] section.

        for example the string returned from the above program would be: 
          $shiro1$SHA-256$500000$iTVt1MU5TGEyF8bQandbgw==$8PJy2PeHP1iKaaX4ELInUdeoqN+GVJKYUFWDiCF46R4=

        Then the line in the shiro.ini file would be:
          Root = $shiro1$SHA-256$500000$iTVt1MU5TGEyF8bQandbgw==$8PJy2PeHP1iKaaX4ELInUdeoqN+GVJKYUFWDiCF46R4=,Admin
